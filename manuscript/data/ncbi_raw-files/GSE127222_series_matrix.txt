!Series_summary	"Three different progenitor cell subsets in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues derived from 5 obese patients were subjected to AmpliSeq transcriptome profiling. Transcriptomic profiles were analyzed to compare progenitor cell subsets and the impact of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue location. "
!Series_overall_design	"Transcriptomic profiling of 3 different progenitor cell types in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues derived from 5 obese patients (3X2X5=30 samples)."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
